# Case Study Proposal: Blockstream

## What Is It
Blockstream is a Victoria based fintech company that was founded in 2014 to build financial infrastructure and applications based upon Bitcoin which is the most robust and secure blockchain. The company develops a range of products and services based on blockchain technology in order to store and transfer Bitcoin and other digital assets. They invest heavily in research and development to strengthen the Bitcoin ecosystem and protocol to deliver robust and scalable solutions. Blockstream has historically been critisized about its threat to Bitcoin’s decentralized nature, while others defended it as it helps its bitcoin developers raise fund.

Blockstream offers several products including sidechain settlement network Liquid, bitcoin wallet Blockstream Green, a data feed for crypto trades, a Block Explorer, and Blockstream Satellite allowing access to the blockchain without internet. Blockstream has also contributed to the development of ‘layer two’ (meaning a protocol layer on top of bitcoin) scaling technologies, including the Lightning Network, which is intended to facilitate speedier bitcoin transactions while retaining its decentralized nature.

Blockstream has raised a total of $101M in funding over 4 rounds. Their latest funding was raised on Nov 21, 2017 from a Undisclosed round.

## Why This Matters
There are few companies contributing to Bitcoin blockchain more than Blockstream. This Canadian blockchain developer's core mission is to scale Bitcoin with its sidechains called the Liquid Network by building out the ecosystem for this world's biggest cryptocurrency. This network is released on Octover 11, 2018 to extend Bitcoin’s capabilities through facilitating interoperability between the Bitcoin main chain and the Liquid sidechain . 

Blockstream is also behind other prominent intiatives: acting as an angel investor to support the development of Bitcoin scaling solutions such as the Lightning Network and launching a Blockstream satellite system to enable the broadcasting of the full Bitcoin blockchain in the area without internet. Blockstream Mining is another function in this company that enables Bitcoin-focused business and individuals to more easily mine the cryptocurrency themselves, to help maintain the decentralized security of the Bitcoin network.The company also provides comprehensive historical price and market depth data for hundreds of crypto and fiat currency pairs from more than 15 cryptocurrency exchanges around the world for financial firms using Cryptocurrency Data Feed function. 

Individuals at Blockstream are the most experienced and productive Bitcoin Core developers who arguably hold the most crypto protocol knowledge and influence in the world. In addition to all of their Bitcoin work, individuals at Blockstream have been long-time contributors to a number of non-Bitcoin open-source groups including the IETF, W3C, the Linux Foundation and Hyperledger. 

## Why This May be Interesting
When Blockstream raised its seed funding, the investor believe it would become for Bitcoin what Mozilla is for the Internet: a for-profit entity committed to upholding the core values of the protocol. However, the company is more focused on building another layer of Bitcoin rather than contributing to Bitcoin Core and it is blamed for using its influence over Bitcoin Core to make decisions based on what’s best for the company, not the ecosystem as a whole.

The Liquid Network, a sidechain intended to give institutions and crypto exchanges more privacy, faster finality, and tokenized assets while using Bitcoin as well as Blockstream Satellite and Blockstream Mining have, most recently, attracted many criticism. It is critisized that the Liquid seems to take a backstep toward centralization through using a federated model, which is essentially private and centralized. The latter two initiatives has raised concerns about the company may dictate to its customers and resulting in controlling a substantial part of the hashrate which could cause monopoly of the cryptocurrency.

In spite of these concerns and criticism, Core has always been on the side of scaling which may be solved by Segwit, a feature introduced by a sidechain protocol: Elements Core. The Liquid is built on such protocol and could ultimately achieve decentralized, secure, reliable P2P digital assets that anyone can use in an interoperable manner across blockchains.
