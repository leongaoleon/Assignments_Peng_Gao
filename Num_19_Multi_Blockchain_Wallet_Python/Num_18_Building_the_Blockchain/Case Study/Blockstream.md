**The Liquid Network:**
On October 12, 2015, Blockstream announced the release of its Liquid sidechain prototype which could allow for the transfer of assets between the Liquid sidechain and the bitcoin main blockchain. Liquid is built using Elements Core, a sidechain protocol also designed by Blockstream and built on the Bitcoin Core codebase. Blockstream claims that Liquid reduces the delays and friction involved in a normal transfer of bitcoin.

The Liquid Network, a sidechain intended to give institutions and crypto exchanges more privacy, faster finality, and tokenized assets while using Bitcoin as well as Blockstream Satellite and Blockstream Mining have, most recently, attracted many criticism. It is critisized that the Liquid seems to take a backstep toward centralization through using a federated model, which is essentially private and centralized.

Rusty is tring to implement the Lightning Network during the summer of 2015. Blockstream released version 0.8.1 of c-lightning, its own implementation of the Lightning Network, in February 2020.
